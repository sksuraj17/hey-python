Built a lightweight Flask web application that displays system info, real-time server time, and random programming quotes via a simple web interface. The application is containerized using Chainguard's Python image in a multi-stage Docker build to ensure minimal attack surface and enhanced supply chain security and also to signed the image with cosign for authenticity.
